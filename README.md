Repository of research computing and data howtos aimed at MIT ORCD infrastructure - hopefully useful elsewhere too! 

## about
software and systems used in research are many and varied. figuring out how to use a tool on a particular system or environment can be fiddly and time consuming. this repo is an experiment in a place where people can find (and contribute to?) information on how to get something done.

there are a bunch of other resources too that try to provide a space where people can share tips and tricks (e.g. https://ask.ci, ) or software tool suggestions (e.g. ). 

google search is your friend!
